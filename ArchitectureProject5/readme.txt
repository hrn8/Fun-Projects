This program mimics a cache. Using a function (ex qsort.mips), the simulator performs the operation and keeps track of where 
the memory is accessed, as well as calculates data such as Cycles, CPI, Bubbles, Flushes, Stalls, memory access loads/stores, 
load/store misses, writebacks and the Hit Ratio.

To run in Linux:
./simulator (one of the mips files provided)
ex: ./simulator qsort.mips
