A program I created to randomly generate a random class for one of my favorite video games, Call of Duty Black Ops! While it's only 10 years late,
the program randomly generates a class for the user to use online. To create a class, simply click!

Things I'm looking to implement in the future:
-Hoovering over the weapon shows you its stats
-Hoovering over killstreaks/perks/equipment gives you a description about them
-Weapon Camo (big priority)
-Debugging
