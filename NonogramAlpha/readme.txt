A revived project from the past. This project was originally made in 2018, but I decided to add some fun stuff to it
that I never got around to doing, resulting in a complete revamp of the program. The premise of the game is simple: 
create your own Nonograms and have other people solve them. While the general foundation of the project is finished, 
I am planning on adding more functionality in the future, most notably a holder
for the best time (of solving a particular Nonogram) and new designs for the Nonogram markers.
