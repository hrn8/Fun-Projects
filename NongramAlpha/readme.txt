Hello there!

This is currently a project I am working on! The purpose of this program is to allow the user to generate 
Nonograms and save them to a file to allow others to use it later. Currently this is an early Alpha build
(especially from a design standpoint), but here are some features it currently has.

-Allows Users to change between Music via Options
-Allows Users to generate a desired Nonogram size (length/width), as well as markers.
-By selecting generate, sends the Nonogram object to a file for future use.
